# Machine Learning Exercise 
## -Decision Tree Classifier on car dataset with Streamlit data app

## Objective
This is an exercise on create a Decision Tree Classifier model to predict car class base on the buying price, maintenance price, number of doors, number of seats, luggage boot size and safety level. Data app will create on streamlit for application. <br>

'car_app' is code for the Streamlit app <br>
'develop_model' is code for the python program, include fine tuning of model and visualize the model. <br>

Data is from kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/elikplim/car-evaluation-data-set

## Data Exploration 

### Univariate data anlysis
Imbalance of data - Majority of the cars are classified as 'unacc' and few cars are in the class of 'vgood' and 'good'.

### Bivariate data analysis
Cars that can be classified as 'vgood' or 'good' normally with a medium or low buying price and maintenance fee. The cars should be 4-seater or above and with a medium or big luggage truck, and high safety level.

There is no missing value in the data. <br>
All columns are categorical and with the degree listed as below. Columns are encoded to numerical according as the order in the list below. <br>
buying :    ['vhigh' 'high' 'med' 'low'] <br>
maint :     ['vhigh' 'high' 'med' 'low'] <br>
doors :     ['2' '3' '4' '5more'] <br>
persons :   ['2' '4' 'more'] <br>
lug_boot :  ['small' 'med' 'big'] <br>
safety :    ['low' 'med' 'high'] <br>
class :     ['unacc' 'acc' 'vgood' 'good'] <br>
